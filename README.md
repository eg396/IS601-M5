- Enter the command 'python3 -m main" to run the program!

## Usage

TBD

## TODO list

- Develop REPL Interface
- Develop advanced arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, ^, root)
- Design pattern integration (Observer, Memento, Strategy, Factory, Facade patterns)
- Data management w/ pandas (History management, auto saving / loading)
- Config management
- Take user commands (help, history, exit, clear, undo, redo, save, load)
- Develop error handling (unit / parameterized testing, 100% coverage)
- Develop GitHub actions
